The inn-keeper agrees to let the traveler stay as long as he is paid one ring per day. The traveler does not want to give the innkeeper more than he is due on any day and offers to break the chain up into individual rings. However, breaking a ring reduces its value so the inn-keeper only agrees on the condition that the traveler breaks the minimum number of rings while performing daily payments. 
Along the way, the traveler is permitted to trade for some of the rings he had earlier given to the inn-keeper, if necessary, in order to fulfill the transaction. Suggest how the traveler can fulfill his payment by breaking the minimum number of rings.

The FOR statements loops through each iteration for the values within the range starting with 1 and ending with 15 (not inclusive). Therefore, it loops through the statement 14 times.

Question 15: 
For i and j, the values that were assigned to them before the FOR statement merely assigns value to them and does not affect the FOR statement. However, in the FOR statement, it acts an indicator to assign each iteration for the range.

Question 16:
Since the range starts with 1 and ends with 15, it will loop through 14 times.

Once the x value is being inputted into the g(x) function, the g(x) function returns x+5, which in this case is 10+5=15.

If B is a knight, both B & C will be knights as what B said must be true and as B is already a knight, C will also be a knight. However, if B is a knave, it would mean that C is a knight as he would be lying and B & C will be different as they cannot be both knights or both knaves. Therefore, currently B is still either a knight or knave but we have confirmed that C is a knight.

Looking at C's statement, C states that A is not lying which means that A is a knight.

Q15) 'i' and 'j' are names of the variables which are required for a functional for loop.

While the Sciences and Humanities are as good as instinct to most students considering our formal ' training' in pre-tertiary education, computing is an entirely new field of its own altogether, in which the skills and methodologies we've picked up from years before may no longer be applicable. Akin to learning how to walk again, some of us might struggle greatly with the nature of the Course.

To add:
To whom it may concern, 

  I would like to point out that I completed the entire survey with lengthy explanations and when I submitted the survey - I got logged out of Coursemology and all my explanations were erased. I would just like to provide this feedback as I was genuinely devastated when all my lengthy explanations disappeared. No matter, I learnt quite a bit and had fun with this pre-survey. Thank you <3

P.S - I typed out all the explanations again, still sad though.",Break rings 3 and 8,"  (I would like to solve this problem without the aid of multiple choice, and would provide a reasoning without the use of elimination)

  Firstly, we attempt a single chain break. We yield a link of length 1, and two other links of total lengths (15-1) = 14.
These two links can be of any combination, but we find that the traveller would not make it past day 4 if the combination is 2/12. And not past day 2 if 3/11. We find that a single cut doesn't suffice.

We attempt two cuts now:
With two cuts attempted, we have obviously: 2 links of length 1. Our links in possession are then:
1,1, ?, ?, ?. 
Whereby the three unknown links have to add up to 13 in length.
While two length 1 chains suffice for the first two days. We lack into the third day. If we cut the chain such that 1,1,1,?,?. The two unknown chains will then be of total length 12. We can cut another link such that we have 1,1,1,1,11. But that would yield all days 5 to 10 unpayable. Hence, our option is to cut a chain of 2. Hence:
1,1,1,2,10. We are now presented with another issue: 6 cannot be formed. The gap between the second largest and largest number is too large.

Herein we have a clue, the second largest and largest number cannot have too large a gap, as the summation of all numbers till the second largest must be (largest number - 1) minimally. And that there must be a 2 for day three to be covered.

We try again at 1,1,2,?,?. Whereby the two unknown numbers must add up to 11. We start with the smallest gap possible:
5,6
4,7
3,8 (1+1+2+3 covers number 7, (8-1))
2,9 (1+1+2+2 does not cover all numbers from 7 till 8)
1,10 (1+1+1+1+2 does not cover all numbers from 7 till 9)

We now know that these combinations work:
1,1,2,5,6
1,1,2,4,7
1,1,2,3,8

Looking at the options, the only option in this multiple choice is cutting at 3 and 8 to yield links of these lengths.

","The solution is easier to find when generation 2 is treated symmetrically. In particular, each quadrant is symmetrical about a rotation from the center cell in the 'petri dish'.
We find that the only change is an additional live in the empty cell down 1 and left 2 from the center cell and looking at the bottom left quadrant, rotated for the other quadrants. (The resulting generation 3 is fairly symmetrical).
Herein, overcrowding begins to happen, particularly in the inner ring of generation 2 cells and die in generation 4(up and down 1 left and 1 right, as well as 1 left and 1 right from center). The cells down two and up two and left 1 and right also become populated as a result of the growth in cells in generation 3 bumping neighbour count of these empty cells to three. The identical scenario can be said for the cells three left and right.","REPEAT 3 [REPEAT 4 [FD 60 RT 90] PU FD 30 RT 90 FD 30 LT 90 PD]

FD - move cursor forward

PU - lift the cursor 'up', preventing it from leaving a line when moving
PD - reverse of PU
And that the cursor starts in an upward facing direction, at the bottom left of the screen.

With that in mind option 4 is most apt as REPEAT 4[FD60 RT90] draws a square and returns the cursor to the original vector direction and position.
PU FD 30 Rt 90 FD 30 LT 90 PD shifts the cursor to the center of the first square, by moving in half the square's length while PENUP (30 versus 60).

We then test for A being a Knight. B is a Knave, C and B are not the same 'types' and so C is a Knight. Hence, Knight A is always telling the truth.
A is a Knight. Therefore, the line of logic follows and is circular. A: Knight, B: Knave, C: Knight",8,"We take the initial statuses of the boxes to form simultaneous equations:

For questions 9, 10 and 11, we just have to use the operators accordingly as dictated by the question to arrive at the solution. 

For question 12, the last operator to be used is B(x2). The integer that we must arrive at is 999, which is odd. However, any integer that is multiplied by 2 will be even. Hence, there is no solution for question 12.","It causes the statement <code>y = y + 1</code> to repeat 14 times.

For question 14, since there are 14 integers in the range (1,15), y = y + 1 is repeated 14 times.

For question 15, what i and j represent is each integer in their given ranges. This helps tell the computer to go through each integer in the range until the program is done iterating the set of actions it is supposed to.

h(x) returns twice the value g(x) returns for any given value of x. Hence, h(10) = g(10) * 2 = 15 * 2 = 30

For the denominators in this sequence, they follow the triangular number sequence pattern.

Since B is a knave, what B says cannot be true.
Thus if B is knave, he is lying and C must be a knight.
Since C is a knight, his claim that A is not lying is true. 
Since A is a knight, it is true what C claims of A as knights indeed do not lie.
Hence, A - knight, B - knave, C - knight is a possible scenario.

Now let us consider the scenario in which A is a knave.

A is a knave.
Thus, B must be a knight as A is lying.
Since B is a knight, what B says is true.
Thus if B is knight, he is telling the truth and C is also a knight.
Since C is a knight, his claim that A is not lying must be true. 
However, since A is a knave, C claiming that A is not lying does not make sense as knaves always lie.

Given that Python is a popular and widely used language, I also would like to take this chance to properly get to know and familiarise myself with it.","I have previously tried learning Python on my own but one thing that I struggled with was the limited number of practices to check my understanding and overall learning progress. Thus, it would be great if there were more optional resources for students to try out in their free time as I believe that it will be beneficial especially for those who are new to programming in general.",Break rings 3 and 8,"Firstly from the question, there are two strict conditions that the chosen answer has to satisfy:
1. innkeeper must NOT on any day have more rings than he is due on that day
2. a minimum number of rings are broken

Other important things to note is that for every break in a ring, there will be a total of 3 new segments produced, with the broken ring being one of them. In addition, it is also possible to trade rings to fulfil the number of rings due on that day such that the 2 conditions above are satisfied.

My answer is ""break rings 3 and 8"". When we break rings 3 and 8, we will have 5 different segments each consisting of 2, 1, 4, 1 and 7 rings respectively. Using the different segments and trading system, the following is how the payment of rings can be conducted:
D1: 1
D2: 1 + 1
D3: 2 + 1 (trade 1 out)
D4: 2 + 1 + 1
D5: 4 + 1 (trade 1, 2 out)
D6: 4 + 1 + 1 
D7: 4 + 2 + 1 (trade 1 out)
D8: 4 + 2 + 1 + 1
D9: 7 + 2 (trade 1, 1, 4 out)
D10: 7 + 2 + 1
D11: 7 + 2 + 1 +1
D12: 7 + 4 + 1  (trade 1, 2 out)
D13: 7 + 4 + 2 (trade 1 out)
D14: 7 + 4 + 2 + 1 
D15: 7 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 1

The answer is not ""break ring 8"" or ""break ring 5 and 10"" because in both instances there is no possible way for the innkeeper to not have more rings than is due on that day.
- When we ""break ring 8"", there will be 3 segments each with 7, 1 and 7 rings. On the second day, there is no way to pay the innkeeper 2 rings only. 
- When we ""break 5 and 10"", there will be 5 segments each with 4, 1, 4, 1, and 5 rings. On the third day, there is no way to pay the innkeeper 3 rings only.
Thus both answers are wrong as they do not satisfy the 1st condition.

The answer is also not ""break rings 3, 7 and 11"" or ""break rings 4, 8 and 12"". Although both instances satisfy the first condition, there are a total of three broken rings, which is more than the two broken rings in the option ""break rings 3 and 8"". Thus both answers are wrong as the number of rings broken is not the smallest possible number and the second condition is not satisfied.",bbbbbbbbbbcddde,"From the sequence above, we can observe that a total of n ""b"" and 1 ""d"" will be added to the previous term (n - 1)th term to derive the nth term.

","I drew out the diagram to solve this question.

For generation 3, none of the cells die. However, four additional cells were added in the four corners, leaving the middle area of the diamond shape from generation 2 with a square shape.

Taking into account that a cell becomes populated when it has three neighbours, I firstly deduce that the fifth option from the left is wrong because there should be three populated cells in the top row. 

Option four was also not the answer I was looking for as it was not possible for there to be a populated cell in the middle of the diagram given that it will have four or more neighbours and will die.

Option one was wrong because the single populated cell at the bottom of the diagram disappeared. However, this is not possible given that it was not surrounded by four or more neighbours and should not die.

Lastly, I was left with options two and three, which differed only by two cells. I then deduced the answer to be option two as the two additional cells present in option three should have died and not be present in generation 4 given that it was surrounded by more than four neighbours in generation 3.","REPEAT 3 [REPEAT 4 [FD 60 RT 90] PU FD 30 RT 90 FD 30 LT 90 PD]
","from (i), we can observe that:
- FD gives an output of a blue line that moves from the bottom up 
- PU gives a blank output, where the blue line does not appear and this will continue until the command PD is given
- the numerical value that comes after each command is the distance/length of the output of the given command 

from (ii), we can observe that:
- RT 90 means turning the direction of the output by 90 degrees in the right direction
- LT 90 means turning the direction of the output by 90 degrees in the left direction
- REPEAT [code] results in the entire code in the square brackets being run twice;  

I chose option four as the answer as the code REPEAT 4 [FD 60 RT 90] gives an output of a blue square. Following that, the code PU FD 30 RT 90 FD30 LT 90 PD navigates the output to start in the middle of the newly drawn blue square, and the REPEAT 3 [code] at the beginning repeats the above processes to produce two more blue squares as shown in the final output.",6,4,5,Not enough information to decide,"From the given example, we can observe that when 
- operator A is applied, the output can be derived by adding one to the integer
- operator B is applied, the output can be derived by multiplying the integer by two
- either operator A or B is applied n times, the effect on the integer will also be n times

Q9. Operator A is applied thrice to the integer 3, hence the output is 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 6

Q10. Operator A is first applied to the integer 1, followed by operator B. Hence the output is (1 + 1) x 2 = 4

Q11. Operator B is first applied to the integer 2, followed by operator A. Hence the output is (2 x 2) + 1 = 5

Q12. In this question, operator A is applied to the integer 1, w times followed by operator B and gives an output of 999. There is no solution for w because if we were to work backwards, 999 divided by 2 gives a result which has a decimal. However, it impossible for there to be an output with a decimal from the application of operator A as the addition of integer 1 to the original integer 1 can only give an integer output.","It causes the statement <code>y = y + 1</code> to repeat 15 times.

Hence, in the similar programme, given the range for j, I would think thank it would similarly cause y = y + 1 to repeat in a loop for 15 times.

Q15. I chose the option that i and j keep track of the number of times 1 is added because there is a range given for i and j, meaning they can change and are likely to be counters marking every time the loop is repeated.

Q16. Given that the loop y = y + 1 is repeated 15 times, I chose the answer 20 as 1 will be added to the original y value of 5 fifteen times.",30,"z = h (10)

- (n-1) is added to a of the previous term if n is a even number or subtracted from a of the previous term if n is an odd number
- n is added to b of the previous term

Since we are finding the 6th term, and 6 is an even number,
we can derive it from adding (6-1) to 0 and add 6 to 15 to get the answer 5/21.","A - knight, B - knave, C - knight
","Given that a knight always tells the truth while a knave always lie, 
we can deduce from A's statement that there are only 2 possible scenarios for A and B:
scenario 1 - if A is a knight, B is a knave
scenario 2 - if A is a knave, B is a knight

We can thus omit options 2 and 3, where A and B are both knaves or knights.

Testing scenario 1:
if A is a knight and is telling the truth, B must be a knave, and the statement made by B 'C and I are both knights or both knaves' is not true. 
Hence, C must be a knight which tallies since C is telling the truth that A is not lying.

Testing scenario 2:
if A is a knave and is telling a lie, B must be a knight and is telling the truth. 
Hence, C must likewise be a knight. However, C cannot be a knight in this scenario because he would be lying that A is telling the truth. 
As such, scenario 2 is not feasible.

Given that scenario 1 works, we can thus omit options 5 and 6, as there is only one possibility.
Checking scenario one with options 1 and 4, we can then deduce the answer is option 4.",8,"From the above, we can deduce that

A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string).
The range() function returns a sequence of numbers, starting from 0 by default, and increments by 1 (by default), and ends at a specified number.

As the range function in Q14 starts from 1 and ends at 15,  j is incremented (15-1)=14 times.

Q15)
i and j are the indexing variables for their respective range functions.

Q16)
It is noted that while the code is syntactically correct, no output is seen. The for-loop does not print any value as the print() function is not used in the code.

Finally, for Q16, the answer is 20 as to the starting value of 5, the value 1 is added 15 times. When looking at ""for j in range(1, 15)"" the start of the range being 1 instead of 0 does not affect the end result as when 1 is added to y 0 times, y is still equal to 5.",30,"h(10)

","B states that B and C are either both knights or both knaves.
Assuming that B is a knight, it means that he is telling the truth, which means that C is a knight.
This means that C's claims that A is a knight.
With this, A claims that B is a knave, which has to be true as he is a knight. However, B cannot be proven to be both a knight and a knave at the same time.
Thus, the assumption that B is a knight is wrong, and B is definitely a knave.

When B claims that B and C are either both knights or both knaves, it means that C is a knave from his claims. However, since B is lying, it means that B and C are not both knaves, which means that C is a knight.
Since C is a knight, his claim that A is not lying can be trusted, meaning that A is a knight.
Finally, A's claim that B is a knave is true as he is a knight.",8,"The following equations can be formed from the statements:

To me, the computer is one of mankind’s greatest inventions. Computer science is in essence, learning how to replicate the way the human brain processes information and instruction with a machine.

It is obvious that the machine can outperform the human in terms of memory and the complexity of various operations it can process, including calculations, sequences of instructions.

How well we maximise the machine to plug the gaps and limitations of the human mind depends on how well we are able to communicate instructions, problem-solving and decision-making processes to the machine. This is the meaning and purpose of computational thinking to me that I seek to practise and refine through this module. That is, learning how to write a sequence of instructions to a computer by understanding how it ‘thinks’, so that the computer can return us solutions to problems that are beyond our mental processing and capacity limits.
","Not in particular. Perhaps looking forward to more interesting examples of how computational thinking can be used to simplify and solve complex problems in the mathematical and natural chaotic realm  that have an iterative pattern, such as the Collatz conjecture, the Game of Life and the Mandelbrot set.",Break rings 3 and 8,"Firstly, we know that we definitely have to break at least one ring. But we are only allowed to do so if we break the correct minimum number. Obviously, 1 ring alone is out of the question. Let’s try breaking only 2 rings.

The principle is to, while breaking the minimum number of rings, to also minimise the length of the largest intact chain, but also allow the smaller chains and broken rings to cover as many days as possible before we pay the longest chain.

Also, it must be such that in the event the traveller is not holding on to any broken ring, he can trade the intact chain he is holding on with the denominations he has given the innkeeper in such a way he only pays a net sum of one ring.

If we break 3 and 8, we have the denominations:
1(ring 3)+1(ring 8)+2(rings 1&2)+4(rings 4-7)+7(rings 9-15)
Day1: Pay Ring 3
Day 2: Pay ring 1&2, take back ring 3, . 
Day 3: Pay back 3rd ring.  (we want to keep delaying days)
Day 4: Pay ring 8.
Day 5: Pay rings 4-7 and take back rings 1, 2 and broken ring3.

Day 6: Pay broken ring 3.
Day 7: Pay 1&2 and take back broken ring 8. 
1+4+1 becomes 1+4+2.
Day 8: Pay ring 8. 
Day 9: We have delayed paying the largest denomination long enough. We have already paid all smaller ones. So we pay 9-15th rings and take back 4-7 and the two broken rings 3 and 8.
1+4+2+1 becomes 7+2
Day 10: Pay broken ring 3
Day 11: Pay broken ring 8
Day 12: Now we pay back 4 rings 4-7 and take back broken ring 3 and the intact rings 1 and 2, a repeat of Day 5. 
7+2+1+1 becomes 7+4+1.
Day 13: Pay broken ring 8.
Day 14: Pay back the 2 intact ring 1&2. Take back broken ring 3.

But A says B is a knave, a contradiction.

Therefore, B must be a knave. Let’s see if this works. If B is a knave, he is lying. So B and C must be 1 knight 1 knave and B must be the knave. This makes C the knight, who says that A is not lying. A is thus telling the truth that B is a knave. Therefore A and C must be knights.

Then, I translated the latter part of my pseudo-code into actual code which will look something like this: PU adjust pen to northeast direction PD = PU FD 30 RT 90 FD 30 LT 90 PD. Lastly, I found out that I can simplify the former part of my pseudo-code into an actual code which looks something like this: draw 1 small square = REPEAT 4[FD 60 RT 90].

My answer for Question 12 is 'No solution' because all multiples of 2 should result in an even number. Since 999 is an odd number, it is impossible to derive 999 as our final answer since 999 is not a multiple of 2.","It causes the statement <code>y = y + 1</code> to repeat 14 times.

",19,"Looking at Question 14, for j in range(1, 15) causes whichever code that is indented within this code block (in this case, the code y = y + 1 is indented within it) to repeat 14 times. Therefore, to derive the final value of y in Question 16, simply add the original value of y, 5, by a value of 1 and repeat this process a total of 14 times. In other words, final y-value = 5 + 14 = 19, therefore my answer for Question 16 is option 2.",30,"Firstly, looking at the last line of code z = h(10) tells us that we are doing a simple substitution of x = 10. To find h(10), first we must find g(10) which will return us a value of g(10) = 10 + 5 = 15. Therefore, h(10) = g(10) x 2 = 15 x 2 = 30, hence my answer for Question 18 is option 3.",5/21,"Let us first look at the first number on the left hand side of the '/' sign, it follows a pattern of '+ 1, - 2, + 3, - 4, ...' therefore the 6th term of the sequence should be 0 + 5 = 5. Next let us explore the second number on the right hand side of the '/' sign, it follows a pattern of ' + 2, + 3, + 4, + 5, ...' therefore the 6th term of the sequence should be 15 + 6 = 21. Hence, my answer for Question 20 is option 4. ","A - knight, B - knave, C - knight
","Firstly, let us explore a scenario where A is a knight. If that is the case, A is telling the truth which means B must be a knave. This will also mean that B is lying and that B and C should have different identities, therefore C must be a knight. To verify that this scenario is possible, we look at the last statement which states that C claims that A is not lying, which is in fact true since both of them are knights who always tell the truth. Therefore, option 5 is eliminated. Next let us explore another scenario where A is a knave. If that is the case, A must be lying and that B must be a knight. This will also mean that B is telling the truth and that B and C should have the same identity, therefore C must be a knight. To verify if this scenario is possible, we look at the last statement once again which states that C claims that A is not lying, which is actually false since A is a knave who always lies. Therefore, option 6 is eliminated and my answer for Question 22 is option 4.",8,"Looking at the last line of statement, if there are 3 times as many apples in boxes A and C combined when compared to box B, this means that the total number of apples in all 3 boxes should be divisible by 4 units (assuming box B represents 1 unit and boxes A and C combined represents 3 units). This helps us to eliminate options 1, 4 and 5. The next step is a trial-and-error process whereby we substitute the total number of apples in all 3 boxes to be 8, 12, and 20 respectively to see if any of these options fulfils all the conditions of the question. Otherwise, the answer would be option 7. Looking at the 3rd line, if 1 apple is taken from B and placed in C, box C will have 6 times the number of apples in box A. This means that A + C + 1 should be divisible by 7 units (assuming box A represents 1 unit). Using trial-and-error, if the total number of apples in all 3 boxes is 8, that means that A + C = 6 apples and B = 2 apples. Therefore, A + C + 1 = 6 + 1 = 7 which is a factor of 7. That means A = 1 apple and C + 1 = 6 apples, therefore C = 6 - 1 = 5 apples. So currently, we have A = 1 apple, B = 2 apples and C = 5 apples. To double-check our answer, we look at the 2nd line which states that C - 1 = A + 1 + B. In this case, 5 - 1 = 1 + 1 + 2 = 4, since the final equation holds true, thus my answer for Question 24 is option 2.",Chong Shao Wei,53.0,0.95,24448.0,0.9196873960758232,148.0,23.6,False,Esther,250.0,250.0,275.0,275.0,250.0,250.0,250.0,250.0,225.0,-,,0,1935

For question 12, applying B to an integer results in a new integer that will always be even. In question 12, B was the last operator used, but the resulting number is odd. Thus, there is no solution.","It causes the statement ""y = y + 1"" to repeat 14 times.

","Start by assuming A to be knight. By that, B = knave. Since B is lying, it means that C will have to be the role that B is not. Thus, C = knight. Since C claims A is not lying, this means that A is the knight. Thus, it is logical to assume A to be a knight.

Assuming A to be knave: B = knight. Thus, C will have to be a knight. However, this means that A is not lying. A cannot be not lying if A is a knave. Thus A being a knave is not logical.

for question number 12, we need to do the addition first since A was applied first. Hence, we need to find the result from the addition before applying operators B. In other words we can write it like this (1+A+...+A)*2=999.

For example, breaking ring 8 would give us chain of rings 1-7, ring 8, and chain 9-15, meaning we have a 2 chains of 7 rings, and 1 ring. The question states that we are permitted to trade for some rings to fulfill our transaction. To be able to fulfill our requirements, this means that by the end of the 15th day, the innkeeper must have 15 rings. This means that with each day, assuming we give 1 ring to the keeper on the first day, there must be a net increase of 1 ring per day on the innkeeper's side.

If we take case 1 (break ring 8) into consideration, the breakdown would be as follows (let I be innkeeper's count, M be our count):
Day 1: I = 1 ring, M = 7,1
Day 2: I = 7, M =1,1 (we trade the 1 ring for our chain of 7)
Day 3: I = 7+1, M=1
Day 4: I = 7+1+1, M=0
As we can see here, from day 4 onwards, we are unable to make payment.

Evaluating our options, breaking at 3 and 8 would be the most suitable, with the least cuts.
D1: I = 1, M =2,1,4,7
D2: I = 2, M=1,1,4,7
D3: I = 2+1, M=1,4,7
D4: I =4, M=2,1,1,7
D5: I = 4+1, M=2,1,7
D6: I =4+1+1, M=2,7
D7: I=7, M=2,1,4,1 (we trade in our chain of 7 for the chain of 4 and two 1 ring)
D8: I=7+1, M=2,1,4
D9: I=7+2, M=1,1,4
D10: I = 7+1+2, M = 1,4 
D11: I = 7+4, M=1,2,1 (we trade in our chain of 4, for the chain of 2 and 1 ring)
D12: I = 7+4+1, M=1,2
D13: I= 7+4+2, M =1,1

","They keep track of the number of times 1 is added to <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>.
",19,"Qn14: To my understanding, the for statement causes the computer to iterate through each element in a given condition, in which case it is range(1,15). range(1,15) actually consists of the numbers 1 to 14, as 15 is not included. Hence, the computer iterates through 14 elements (numbers 1 to 14), and for each of these 14 elements, it runs the statement y = y+1, therefore effectively running y=y+1 14 times.

Qn15: By specifying the i/j to be in the for statement as the arbitrary variable, and assigning the value of 0 to i/j at the start, as the computer iterates through the specified range, the value of i/j will increase by 1. Hence, it serves as the count for the number of times the computer has iterated through the range, and therefore, counting the number of times 1 has been added to x/y.

Qn 16: The specified range is range(1,15), which in effect is actually the numbers 1 to 14, meaning that the computer runs y = y+1 14 times. Since y starts off as 5, if we add 1 to 5, 14 times, we get 19. ",30,"g(x) is a function that returns (x+5) for whatever value of x we pass into the function.
h(x) is a function that runs the function g(x) for whatever value of x passed into it first, then returning the value of that multiplied by 2.
Hence, passing 10 into h(x) is effectively, (10+5)*2, which gives us 30.",5/21,"For the numerator, it alternates between adding odd numbers and subtracting even numbers. The pattern changes as follows: +1, -2, +3, -4 etc. Hence numerator would be 5. For denominator, the pattern follows an arithmetic progression of +1, so the pattern changes as follows: +1,+2,+3.... Therefore denominator would be 21. Hence, the answer.","A - knight, B - knave, C - knight
","The starting point for this question should be from B as his statement is the easiest to verify.

If we take B to be a knight, this means B and C must have the same role. Looking at our options, we can strike off the possibility that B is a knight, since every option where B is a knight, has C as a knave i.e they are different roles. This means that B has to be a knave. Another way of evaluating it would be, if B was a knight, this means C has to be true, meaning that A is speaking the truth that B is not a knight, which contradicts itself. Therefore B has to be a knave. 

Taking B to be a knave, C therefore has to be a knight. Since C is speaking the truth that A is not lying, if we evaluate what A says, we come to realise that A is speaking the truth (B is a knave) as well. Hence, both A and C are knights.",8,"We let the number of apples in A,B and C be a,b and c respectively.
We are able to derive 3 equations.
(1): c = a + b + 2 
(2): c +1 = 6a
(3): a + c =3b

Our desired outcome is to find a + b + c.
a + b + c can also be represented as 2a + 2b + 2 [substitute (1)]
a + b + c can also be represented as 4b [substitute (3)]
therefore we can equate:
2a + 2b  + 2 = 4b
Simplifying the equation, we get equation 4:
(4): b = a + 1

Substituting (4) into (3), we get,
a + c = 3a + 3
Comparing this with equation (2), we can simplify it as shown,
c - 3 = 2a
c + 1 = 6a
c + 1 - (c -3) = 4a     [we subtract 2a from 6a]
4 = 4a
a = 1

since a = 1, b = 2.
therefore, c = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5.

So i am going to pick 3 and 8

so now break at 3 and 8 and we are going to get (1, 2), (3, ), (4, 7), (8, ), (9, 15)
so we have in terms of number of rings in each tuple: [2R, 1R, 4R, 1R, 7R]  (R stands for ring)

day 1: 1R
day 2: 1R + 1R 
day 3: 2R + 1R (take back 1R)
day 4: 2R + 1R + 1R
day 5: 4R + 1R (take back 2R 1R)
day 6: 4R  + 1R + 1R
day 7: 7R (take back 4R 1R 1R)
day 8: 7R + 1R
day 9: 7R + 1R + 1R
day 10: 7R + 2R + 1R (take back 1R)
day 11: 7R + 2R + 1R + 1R 
day 12: 7R + 4R + 1R  (take back 2R 1R)
day 13: 7R + 4R + 1R + 1R
day 14: 7R + 4R + 2R + 1R (take back 1R)
day 15: give everything


I suppose an even better answer is to have faith in the shopkeeper and give him the whole chain.

Based on these 2 functions, the results to questions 9-11 can be obtained. 

Question 12 does not have any solution as the final result is 999 which is an odd number. 
Since the last operation was function B which is to double the previous number,

it is not possible for an integer to be doubled to result in an odd number (999).

The pattern is +1, -2, +3, -4 
It can be observed that the pattern follows the formula [(-1)^(n+1)]*n
since the next term in the pattern is n=5,  
the pattern will produce [(-1)^(5+1)]*5= +5

Therefore, B must be a knave.

As such, i and j are numbers which continues to add to x and y as they are within a range from 0 to n - 1. 

For the final value of y, I calculated the value by adding 5 to the maximum number in j range which is 14 and adding 1 to it at the end. Hence, y = 5 + 14 + 1 = 20. ",30,"For the above example,

If we only break ring 8, this means m=we have pieces of 7 rings, 1 ring, and 7 rings. This means that the traveler cannot even pay 2 rings to the inn-keeper by day 2. It does not satisfy the traveler's want of paying only 2 rings on the 2nd day. Now, let's say we attempt to break 2 rings. If we break rings 5 and 10, then we have pieces of 4 rings, 1 ring, 4 rings, 1 ring, and 4 rings. Unfortunately, the traveler, won't be able to pay 7 rings. So this does not work. Now, let's say we break rings 3 and 8. Now, we have pieces of 2 rings, 1 ring, 4 rings, 1 ring, and 7 rings.
Now, look at the following algorithm:
1 = 1
2 = 1 + 1
3 = 2 + 1 (trade the 1 ring with 2 rings)
4 = 4 (trade the 1 ring and 2 rings with 4 rings)
5 = 4 + 1
6 = 4 + 1 + 1
7 = 4 + 2 + 1 (trade the 1 ring with 2 rings)
8 = 7 + 1 (trade the 4 rings and 2 rings with 7 rings)
9 = 7 + 2 (trade the 1 ring with 2 rings)
10 = 7 + 2 + 1
11 = 7 + 2 + 1 + 1
12 = 7 + 4 + 1 (trade the 1 ring and 2 rings with 4 rings)
13 = 7 + 4 + 2 (trade the 1 ring with 2 rings)
14 = 7 + 4 + 2 + 1
 15 = 7 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 1

","Let's say the dots placed in a coordinate plane with lattice points within the restricted points of (0, 0), (0, 8), (8, 8), and (8, 0). Notice that the points (3, 4) and (7, 4) in the [Generation 2] have 2 neighbours respectively. While all of the other lattice points in the Generation 2 have exactly 3 neighbours. This means that no cell will die when in [Generation 2]. Since the points (2, 4), (6, 4), (2, 6), (6, 6) have exactly 3 neighbours, these 4 points will be populated in the [Generation 3]. Going to [Generation 4], some cells will die due to overpopulation. However, according to the transition of [Generation 1] to [Generation 2], those empty cells with three neighbours will be populated before the current cells die. We observe that (1, 5), (7, 5), (3, 3), (5, 3), (3, 7), (5, 7) have exactly three neighbours in [Generation 2]. So, these points will be populated in [Generation 4]. Now, we see that (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (5, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6) have more than 4 neighbours. Thus, these cells will die.

It is obvious to observe that f(x) is always an integer.
Let's say f(f(....(f(1))...)) = a where f is repeated w times.
This means that a is an integer and 999 = g(a)
Thus, 999 = 2a

The i and j are the numbers that define the number of cycles that should be repeated. According to the second loop, j starts with 1 and will be incremented by 1 until 14, as the loop defines that j should be less than 15. Therefore the function y = y + 1 goes 14 times.

","Let's assume that A is a knave.
Then A lied about the fact that B is a knave.
So B is a knight.
From that point, C is also a knight as B is honest about the fact that both of them are knights.
This means that C is true that A is not lying. 
Thus, A is not always lying (not a knave)
This leads us to a contradition from the fact that A is a knave.
Therefore, A must not be a knave.

On the other side, observe when A is a knight.
This means that A is not lying about the fact that B is a knave.
So, B always lies.
Thus, C is not a knave as B lies about the fact that they are both the same type.
As C is a knight, he is honestly sure that A did not lie.
The fact that A is knight means that A never lie.
So, the statement in the question can only be satisfied if and only if A is a knight.

up till here, the inn keeper has a broken ring 3, broken ring 8, the 2-ring chain, 4-ring chain

",19,"q14: x was first defined as 2, after range (0,10) was implemented x = x + 1, x becomes 12
the explanation would be that:
x = 2 + 1 = 3
x1 = x + 1 = 3 + 1 = 4
x2 = x1 + 1 = 4 + 1 = 5

","Starting with A, assuming A is a knave (lies), what A says is false, so B is presumably a knight. A knight always tells the truth, so B and C are both knights. However if C is a knight, means that what A is saying is true, and B is indeed a knave. This different conclusions rules out the possibility of the combination having A as a knave.

Assuming A is a knight, B will be a knave. If B is a knave, C will be a knight since what B says is a lie. Given that C is a knight and claims that A is speaking the truth, B is indeed a knave. This matching conclusion indicates the possibility of (A knight, B knave, C knight)
",8,"by solving via simultaneous equation, first by putting together information from the question,
C - 1 = A + B + 1

Using eqns 2 & 3,

The first point to note is that ""Along the way, the traveler is permitted to trade for some of the rings he had earlier given to the inn-keeper"". This means we can simplify the question to using numbers that are as few as possible to express all numbers from 1 to 15. We know that the minimum numbers to use are 1,2,4,8. 
The second point to note is that after one cut at the xth ring, the three chains produced have ring numbers of (x-1),1,(15-x) respectively. After one cut, the total number of separate parts (i.e the numbers of numbers used to count from 1 to 15) increases by 2. Hence, we eliminate choices 1, 4, and 5 as two cuts will suffice which produce 5 separate parts. (5>4)
Then we start to see the answer, as the one that produces 1,2,4,8 (with sum also can) is the correct answer. we can see that there's more than 1 correct answer as well, as seen from some examples listed below.
1,1,2,3,8 (with 1+1+2 added up to 4)
1,1,2,4,7 (with 1+7 added up to 8)
1,1,2,2,8 (with 1+1 added up to 2 and 2+2 added up to 4)

However, the third condition, there are 3 times as many apples in box A and box C as compared to box B can only be satisfied if the total number of apples is 8.

The total demographic of the division is as follows: 2 sets of 1 unit chains (Ring 3 and 8), 1 set of 2 unit chains (Ring 1 to 2), 1 set of  4 unit chains (Ring 4 to 7) and 1 set of 7 unit chains (Ring 9 to 15).

The reason why breaking ring 8 alone is insufficient is because it does not provide enough units of small enough value in order to fulfill the requirements for certain days. For example, he could not pay just 2 rings on day 2 because he cannot form a 2 ring chain for payment.

When the question stated that ""breaking a ring reduces its value"" I can eliminate options 4 and 5 since they require 3 rings to be broken. Option 1 can also be eliminated since breaking of only 1 ring will not allow the innkeeper to only have N rings on any N^th given day.

After that, all that is left to do is to test out Options 2 and 3.

I started by testing Option 2.

By breaking rings 3 and 8, we have the following pieces:

3 (1 ring)
4 + 5 + 6 + 7 (4 rings) 
8 (1 ring)
9 + 10 + 11 + 12 + 13 + 14 +15  (7 rings)

On 2nd day, trade the set of 2 rings for the set of 1 ring back. This way, the innkeeper only has 2 rings.
On 3rd day, pay innkeeper another set of 1 ring. 
On 4th day, pay innkeeper another set of 1 ring. 
On 5th day, trade the set of 4 rings for 1 set of 2 rings and 1 set of 1 ring back. This way, the innkeeper has 1 set of 4 and 1 set of 1 which makes it 5.
On 6th day, pay innkeeper another set of 1 ring.
On 7th day, trade innkeeper the set of 7 rings and take everything else back. 
From then on, just keep doing simple payment and trades until the 15th day.
