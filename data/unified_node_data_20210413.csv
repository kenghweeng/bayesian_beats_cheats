The inn-keeper agrees to let the traveler stay as long as he is paid one ring per day. The traveler does not want to give the innkeeper more than he is due on any day and offers to break the chain up into individual rings. However, breaking a ring reduces its value so the inn-keeper only agrees on the condition that the traveler breaks the minimum number of rings while performing daily payments. 
Along the way, the traveler is permitted to trade for some of the rings he had earlier given to the inn-keeper, if necessary, in order to fulfill the transaction. Suggest how the traveler can fulfill his payment by breaking the minimum number of rings.

",19,"q14: x was first defined as 2, after range (0,10) was implemented x = x + 1, x becomes 12
the explanation would be that:
x = 2 + 1 = 3
x1 = x + 1 = 3 + 1 = 4
x2 = x1 + 1 = 4 + 1 = 5
going on all the way to reach 12, x will be x9

given the range (1,15), y = y + 1 should be repeated for (15-1) = 14 times

q15 since different variables ii and j are present, they are able to change in values according to number of times 1 is added

q16 solving by the same way in q14

y1 = y + 1 = 6 + 1 = 7

applying the same concept in the next part, 
for g(x), it will give x + 5 as the answer
whereas for h(x), it will give g(x) x 2 = [(x + 5) x 2] as the answer

given z = h (10), x=10
by substituting the value into h(x) = [(x + 5) x 2]
h (10) = [(10 + 5) x 2] = 15 x 2 = 30",5/21,"Looking at the numerators: 2 , 3 , 1 , 4 , 0

the addition is as follows: + 1 , - 2 , + 3 , - 4...
addition of odd integers, subtraction of even integers 
so the next addition is + 5 as it is the odd sequence
0 + 5 = 5
hence the numerator is 5

Looking at the denominators: 1 , 3 , 6 , 10 , 15
1 + 2 = 3

","A - knight, B - knave, C - knight
","Starting with A, assuming A is a knave (lies), what A says is false, so B is presumably a knight. A knight always tells the truth, so B and C are both knights. However if C is a knight, means that what A is saying is true, and B is indeed a knave. This different conclusions rules out the possibility of the combination having A as a knave.

Assuming A is a knight, B will be a knave. If B is a knave, C will be a knight since what B says is a lie. Given that C is a knight and claims that A is speaking the truth, B is indeed a knave. This matching conclusion indicates the possibility of (A knight, B knave, C knight)
",8,"by solving via simultaneous equation, first by putting together information from the question,
C - 1 = A + B + 1
C + 1 = 6A
A + C = 3B

then derive these 3 equations respectively:
Eqn 1) A + B - C = - 2
Eqn 2) 6A - C = 1
Eqn 3) A + C = 3B

Using eqns 1 & 2, we make B the subject
1) C = A + B + 2
2) C = 6A - 1

A + B + 2 = 6A - 1
B = 5A - 3 --- eqn 4

Using eqns 2 & 3,
6A - 1 = 3B - A
by substituting eqn 4,
6A - 1 = 3 (5A - 3) - A
6A - 1 = 15A - 9 - A
8A = 8
A = 1

I had to google this for a hint because I couldn't really understand the question. Like if we supposed we had (1, 3) and we broke the ring at position 2, does this mean that we get (1, 1.5) and (1.5, 3)?  Or do we get (1, ), (2, ), (3, ), where breaking at 2 preserves the ring. So later google told me that it is the latter. For example if there was a (1, 5) link, and we break at  position 3, we would have (1, 2), (3, ) and (4, 5). Okay so I didn't want to scroll further but it was too late and I already saw the hint.

The hint was ""create all numbers from 1 to 15 using the rings."" (not gonna lie, I didn't think of this in either interpretation above)

Incorrect: A = knave, B = knight, C = knight

Second possibility is A is a knight. He tells the truth, hence B is a knave. As such, because he is stating a lie when he says they are both knight or knaves, C will not be the same as B and will be a knight.

","Not too sure on how this works, picked the answer that made most sense to me.",6,4,5,No solution,"From the information given in the preamble, the operator A represents ""+1"" and the operator B represents ""x2"". 

For questions 9, 10 and 11, we just have to use the operators accordingly as dictated by the question to arrive at the solution. 

For question 12, the last operator to be used is B(x2). The integer that we must arrive at is 999, which is odd. However, any integer that is multiplied by 2 will be even. Hence, there is no solution for question 12.","It causes the statement <code>y = y + 1</code> to repeat 14 times.

",19,"For i/j in their specified ranges can be read as, ""for each integer in range(...)"". Hence, the number of integers within that range represents the number of times the following sets of actions are repeated in the program.

For question 14, since there are 14 integers in the range (1,15), y = y + 1 is repeated 14 times.

For question 15, what i and j represent is each integer in their given ranges. This helps tell the computer to go through each integer in the range until the program is done iterating the set of actions it is supposed to.

For question 16, since y is initialised to a value of 5 and the action y = y + 1 is repeated 14 times, the final value will equal to 19.",30,"According to the program we are given to consider,

g(x) will return x+5 for any given value of x. In this case, the given value of x is 10. Hence g(10) = 10 + 5 = 15

h(x) returns twice the value g(x) returns for any given value of x. Hence, h(10) = g(10) * 2 = 15 * 2 = 30

Since z = h(10), z = 30.",5/21,"This sequence deals with fractions. Fractions comprise of numerators and denominators.

For the numerators in this sequence, they follow this pattern: +1,-2,+3,-4,...
Using this logic, to obtain the numerator of the next number, we must perform +5 on the preceding numerator(0).
Hence the numerator = 0 + 5 = 5

For the denominators in this sequence, they follow the triangular number sequence pattern.
Using this logic, to obtain the denominator of the next number, we must perform +6 on 15.
Hence the denominator = 15 + 6 = 21

Hence, the next number is 5/21.","A - knight, B - knave, C - knight
","The flow of events begin with what A has to say. So let us consider the following possibilities, starting with letting the identity of A be a knight.

A is a knight.
Thus, B must be a knave.
Since B is a knave, what B says cannot be true.
Thus if B is knave, he is lying and C must be a knight.
Since C is a knight, his claim that A is not lying is true. 
Since A is a knight, it is true what C claims of A as knights indeed do not lie.
Hence, A - knight, B - knave, C - knight is a possible scenario.

Now let us consider the scenario in which A is a knave.

A is a knave.
Thus, B must be a knight as A is lying.
Since B is a knight, what B says is true.
Thus if B is knight, he is telling the truth and C is also a knight.
Since C is a knight, his claim that A is not lying must be true. 
However, since A is a knave, C claiming that A is not lying does not make sense as knaves always lie.

Hence, there is no other solution apart from the one we had derived in the first scenario.",8,"From the information given to us in the question, we can derive 3 equations.

","First, we must consider the space to be a 3x3 area arnd the single target cell of interest. Second, for simplicity, we will consider the first row to be the highest x in generation 2 and the last row in generation 2 to be the lowest x. From generation 2 to generation 3, following the given rules, the number of rows of x does not increase. For easy depiction, the digits 1,2,3 etc. will be used to represent the number of 'x' and the digits (1),(2),(3) etc. will be used to depict the number of '.'. Each ',' given will be used to indicate the end of the current row and the start of the next. Hence, generation 2 will be seen as this sequence taking note we will not be considering any rows that are purely '.' : (4)1(4), (3)1(1)1(3), (2)2(1)2(2), (3)1(1)1(3), (4)1(4). 

Thus following the above rules, we may deduce that generation 3 will not have any new rows and will follow the sequence/pattern of: (4)1(4), (2)2(1)2(2), (2)2(1)2(2), (2)2(1)2(2), (4)1(4). Therefore, from this we can once again infer that generation 4 will not have any new rows and will follow the sequence/pattern of: (3)3(3), (2)1(3)1(2), (1)1(5)1(1), (2)1(3)1(2), (3)3(3).","REPEAT 3 [REPEAT 4 [FD 60 RT 90] PU FD 30 RT 90 FD 30 LT 90 PD]
","First, we must define each keyword, FD meaning moving the point of the pen forward by x no. of units, PU meaning where the point of the pen is no longer in contact with the surface, PD meaning setting the pen down to contact the surface that is being drawn on, LT meaning making a left turn by y angle at a point and RT meaning making a right turn by y angle at a point. Hence for my answer to question 7. Essentially we start with the inner most bracket FD 60 RT 90, meaning moving the pen by 60 units and then making a 90 degree angle right turn on the point. This is repeated 4 times to draw the first square. 
Next, PU FD 30 RT 90 FD 30 LT 90 PD, this collection of keywords is to position the pen to draw the next square, so Pen up as we do not want to draw, moving 30 units (half the length of the square) forward from the bottom left corner (start point) of the first square. Then turning 90 degrees to the right on the point ad moving a further 30 units (half the length of the square), turning 90 degrees to the left on the point and putting the pen down to get ready to draw the next square. This process is repeated for 3 times as we can see as we are drawing 3 squares.",6,4,5,No solution,"Essentially, we may treat each --> A as a plus 1 and each --> B as a multiplication of .

For question 9, we observe the starting digit is 3 and there are 3 As meaning 3+3 giving us 6.
For question 10, we observe the starting digit of 1. There is 1 A followed by 1 B. Hence, it would mean, (1+1)*2, giving us 4
For question 11, we observe the starting digit of 2. There is 1 B followed by 1 A. Hence, it would mean (2*2)+1, giving us 5
For question 12, we observe that the starting digit is 1 and the end digit is 999. As the final operator used is a B, this would imply that the number x * 2 would give us the number 999, however, that number would be a non-whole number 499.5. As we can see that the starting digit is a whole number 1 and that the operator A is an addition of a whole number 1, it is impossible to obtain a number containing a decimal following the application of the operators A.","It causes the statement <code>y = y + 1</code> to repeat 14 times.
","They allow the computer to understand the program.
",19,"With the command range(a,b), it first must be noted that the end of the range y is non-inclusive meaning that essentially the actual range recognised by the program is from a,....,(b-1). 
Hence for question 14, from the range(1,15), there are only 14 digits present in this range as such, the for loop will be repeated 14 times where in the for loop, we wanted y = y +1 to be performed 14 times.

For question 15, essentially i and j are recognised to be the elements/variables of the range(a,b). They do not serve as a counter as they will simply be assigned the last number of the range.

As such for question 16, basically what happens is that y which is equal to 5 will experience an addition of 1 14 times hence y will have a final value of 19.",30,"Basically, where x = 10 with the function h(x), x = 10 will first perform the function g(x), where g(10) = 15, next the function h(x) performed where g(10) or 15 *2 giving the result of 30",5/21,"Essentially, for the numerator a value will be added or subtracted following the magnitude of 1,2,3,4,5,6 etc. however, for every odd number it will be positive, while for every even number it will be negative. Meaning to say the pattern is as follows +1,-2,+3,-4,+5,-6. etc. 
Next, for the denominator, it is basically an addition of values starting with 2 with each subsequent addition being 1 more than the previous addition, the sequence will be +2,+3,+4,+5,+6 .etc. 
Hence, from this we are able to deduce that the next number will be 5/21 as the previous number 0/15 will go through the following changes, the numerator will be added by 5 and the denominator will be added 6 resulting in the number 5/21.","A - knight, B - knave, C - knight
","The answer of who is a knight and knave actually stems from C's statement as a starting point and B's statement as a validation of whether the conditions are correct. 
Consider the cases where C's statement is true and false:

If C's statement is true where C is a knight,
This would imply that A's statement is true and that A is a knight.
As A's statement is true, B's statement is false, meaning that B is telling a lie. If B is telling a lie, this would imply that B and C are of different roles. This is validated correctly as in this case we assume that C is telling the truth making him a knight and that B is telling a lie making him a knave. As such all statements make sense and validate the conclusion that A is a knight, B is a Knave and C is a Knight.

If C's statement is false where C is a Knave,
This would imply that A's statement is false, as such A is a knave.
As A's statement is false, this would imply that B is a Knight hence B's statement must be true.
However, there is a contradiction if B's statement is true following this case where C's statement is false, as if B's statement is true given that C's statement is false, this would imply that B is a knight and that C must be a knight as well, however we have set the condition where C is a knave. Hence due to this logical contradiction, such a case is impossible

As such, the answer is A - Knight, B - Knave and C - Knight.",8,"Interpret the Question from an algebric stand point for each statement:

Then, I proceeded to assume the second possibility where 'C' is a knave. As such, 'A' must be a knave as he is lying (since 'C' claims 'A' is not lying which is a lie). Since 'A' would lie, 'B' is therefore a knight. This would make 'C' a knight as well since 'B' (who is a knight and only tells the truth) claims that both 'C' and 'B' are of the same group. This would lead to a contradiction as we previously assumed 'C' to be a knave. As such, this situation is false.

For example, breaking ring 8 would give us chain of rings 1-7, ring 8, and chain 9-15, meaning we have a 2 chains of 7 rings, and 1 ring. The question states that we are permitted to trade for some rings to fulfill our transaction. To be able to fulfill our requirements, this means that by the end of the 15th day, the innkeeper must have 15 rings. This means that with each day, assuming we give 1 ring to the keeper on the first day, there must be a net increase of 1 ring per day on the innkeeper's side.

If we take case 1 (break ring 8) into consideration, the breakdown would be as follows (let I be innkeeper's count, M be our count):
Day 1: I = 1 ring, M = 7,1
Day 2: I = 7, M =1,1 (we trade the 1 ring for our chain of 7)
Day 3: I = 7+1, M=1
Day 4: I = 7+1+1, M=0
As we can see here, from day 4 onwards, we are unable to make payment.

Evaluating our options, breaking at 3 and 8 would be the most suitable, with the least cuts.
D1: I = 1, M =2,1,4,7
D2: I = 2, M=1,1,4,7
D3: I = 2+1, M=1,4,7
D4: I =4, M=2,1,1,7
D5: I = 4+1, M=2,1,7
D6: I =4+1+1, M=2,7
D7: I=7, M=2,1,4,1 (we trade in our chain of 7 for the chain of 4 and two 1 ring)
D8: I=7+1, M=2,1,4
D9: I=7+2, M=1,1,4
D10: I = 7+1+2, M = 1,4 
D11: I = 7+4, M=1,2,1 (we trade in our chain of 4, for the chain of 2 and 1 ring)
D12: I = 7+4+1, M=1,2
D13: I= 7+4+2, M =1,1
D14: I = 7+4+2+1, M=1
D15: I = 7+4+2+1+1

For the number of Ds, they increase by 1, with 0 at the 1st number. Hence, the answer should have 3 Ds. Therefore, the last answer.","

","They keep track of the number of times 1 is added to <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>.
",19,"Qn14: To my understanding, the for statement causes the computer to iterate through each element in a given condition, in which case it is range(1,15). range(1,15) actually consists of the numbers 1 to 14, as 15 is not included. Hence, the computer iterates through 14 elements (numbers 1 to 14), and for each of these 14 elements, it runs the statement y = y+1, therefore effectively running y=y+1 14 times.

Qn15: By specifying the i/j to be in the for statement as the arbitrary variable, and assigning the value of 0 to i/j at the start, as the computer iterates through the specified range, the value of i/j will increase by 1. Hence, it serves as the count for the number of times the computer has iterated through the range, and therefore, counting the number of times 1 has been added to x/y.

Qn 16: The specified range is range(1,15), which in effect is actually the numbers 1 to 14, meaning that the computer runs y = y+1 14 times. Since y starts off as 5, if we add 1 to 5, 14 times, we get 19. ",30,"g(x) is a function that returns (x+5) for whatever value of x we pass into the function.
h(x) is a function that runs the function g(x) for whatever value of x passed into it first, then returning the value of that multiplied by 2.
Hence, passing 10 into h(x) is effectively, (10+5)*2, which gives us 30.",5/21,"For the numerator, it alternates between adding odd numbers and subtracting even numbers. The pattern changes as follows: +1, -2, +3, -4 etc. Hence numerator would be 5. For denominator, the pattern follows an arithmetic progression of +1, so the pattern changes as follows: +1,+2,+3.... Therefore denominator would be 21. Hence, the answer.","A - knight, B - knave, C - knight
","The starting point for this question should be from B as his statement is the easiest to verify.

If we take B to be a knight, this means B and C must have the same role. Looking at our options, we can strike off the possibility that B is a knight, since every option where B is a knight, has C as a knave i.e they are different roles. This means that B has to be a knave. Another way of evaluating it would be, if B was a knight, this means C has to be true, meaning that A is speaking the truth that B is not a knight, which contradicts itself. Therefore B has to be a knave. 

Taking B to be a knave, C therefore has to be a knight. Since C is speaking the truth that A is not lying, if we evaluate what A says, we come to realise that A is speaking the truth (B is a knave) as well. Hence, both A and C are knights.",8,"We let the number of apples in A,B and C be a,b and c respectively.
We are able to derive 3 equations.
(1): c = a + b + 2 
(2): c +1 = 6a
(3): a + c =3b

Our desired outcome is to find a + b + c.
a + b + c can also be represented as 2a + 2b + 2 [substitute (1)]
a + b + c can also be represented as 4b [substitute (3)]
therefore we can equate:
2a + 2b  + 2 = 4b
Simplifying the equation, we get equation 4:
(4): b = a + 1

Substituting (4) into (3), we get,
a + c = 3a + 3
Comparing this with equation (2), we can simplify it as shown,
c - 3 = 2a
c + 1 = 6a
c + 1 - (c -3) = 4a     [we subtract 2a from 6a]
4 = 4a
a = 1

since a = 1, b = 2.
therefore, c = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5.

Assuming B is a knave, C may either be a knight or a knave. If C is a Knight, then A is also a knight as B would a knave and the only knave.  ",None of the above.;None of the above.,"Without calculations, based on my guess, the number has to be an even number. 

To calculate the exact numbers, I used simultaneous equations. 
C-1 = A+1+B 
C = A + 2 + B ---- (1)
C+1 = 6A ----- (2) 
3(A+C)=B ---- (3)
Substituting equation (1) into equation (2):
A + 2 + B + 1 = 6A
5A -3 = B ---- (4)

Substituting equations (4) and (1) into equation (3):
3A + 3(A + 2+ 5A - 3) = 5A - 3 
6A - 3 + 15A = 5A - 3
21A  = 5A 
A = 0 ---- (5)

Substituting equation (5) into equation (4)  and (1) respectively:
B = -3
C = 0+2-3 
C= -1

A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string).
The range() function returns a sequence of numbers, starting from 0 by default, and increments by 1 (by default), and ends at a specified number. 
(Both definitions referenced from w3schools.com)

As the range function in Q14 starts from 1 and ends at 15,  j is incremented (15-1)=14 times.

Q15)
i and j are the indexing variables for their respective range functions.

Q16)
It is noted that while the code is syntactically correct, no output is seen. The for-loop does not print any value as the print() function is not used in the code. However, by adding print(y) after the loop, the final value of y can be displayed, which is 19.",30,"h(x) is calling another function, g(x), in its code.

","I drew out the diagram of generation 2 on a piece of paper and worked out the diagram for generation 3.
From there, I worked out the diagram for generation 4.","REPEAT 3 [REPEAT 4 [FD 60 RT 90] PU FD 30 RT 90 FD 30 LT 90 PD]
","From output (i), I was able to infer that PU refers to ""lifting up the pen"" such that no line is produced during the FD action while the position of the ""pen"" changes according to the FD command. On the other hand, PD refers to ""putting the pen down"" such that a line is now produced during the FD action. It also shows that the number following any FD command refers to the distance the ""pen"" moves during the FD command.

From output (ii), it can be inferred that RT and LT refer to changing the direction the ""pen"" moves during the following FD commands, rotating right and left respectively. Furthermore, the number that comes after RT or LT refers to the degree of rotation. The ""Repeat"" command causes the program to repeat the commands within the bracket.

From these observations, ""[Repeat 4 [FD 60 RT 90]"" forms a square, followed by ""PU FD 30 RT 90 FD 30 LT 90 PD"" which lifts up the ""pen"", moves it to the middle of the formed square and put the ""pen"" down. The command ""repeat 3"" causes these actions to be repeated 3 times, thus producing the above output.",6,4,5,No solution,"From the examples given, it can be inferred that operator A adds 1 when applied to an integer while operator B multiplies the integer by a factor of 2.

In question 9, operator A is applied to the integer 3 three times, which means 1 is added to 3 three times, thus x= 3+3 which is 6.

In question 10, operator A is first applied to the integer 1 followed by operator B, meaning 1 is added to the integer 1 and the result is multiplied by 2. Hence, y= (1+1) * 2 which is 4.

In question 11, operator B is first applied to the integer 2 followed by operator A, meaning the integer 2 is first multiplied by 2 then 1 is added to the result. This means z = 2*2 + 1 which is 5.

In question 12, A is applied W times to integer 1 followed by operator B which is supposed to result in the integer 999. However, an integer that is multiplied by 2 (having operator B applied to it) will always be an even number. Hence, it is not possible for the end result to be 999, an odd number, meaning there is no solution.

","They don't do anything.
",19,"For question 14, based on the example ""for"" loop given, the ""for"" statement is used to repeat an action. The numbers in the brackets after ""range"" show the number of times the action is repeated.

For question 15, since ""i"" and ""j"" are given the value 0, they effectively do not do anything.

For question 16, the statement y = y + 1 is repeated 14 times, therefore the final value of y is 5 + 14 which is 19.",30,"h(10) = h(g(10))

The sequence for x starting from the first number is 2, 3, 1, 4, 0. The pattern for the changes in each subsequent number is +1, -2, +3, -4. Therefore, the next change in the sequence will be +5, thus for the 6th number in the sequence, x = 0 + 5 which is 5.

The sequence for y starting from the first number is 1, 3, 6, 10, 15. The pattern for the changes in each subsequent numbers is +2, +3, +4, +5. Therefore, the next change in the sequence will be +6, thus for the 6th number in the sequence, y = 15 + 6 which is 21.

To also utilise Computing as a methodology to conduct research in the domain of Physics seeing as how it has become intertwined with Physics and the Sciences, as so with Finance and the Corporate world at large.","I express concern for the nature of grading considering the diverse groups of students doing CS1010S. While the Sciences and Humanities are as good as instinct to most students considering our formal ' training' in pre-tertiary education, computing is an entirely new field of its own altogether, in which the skills and methodologies we've picked up from years before may no longer be applicable. Akin to learning how to walk again, some of us might struggle greatly with the nature of the Course.

To add:
To whom it may concern, 

  I would like to point out that I completed the entire survey with lengthy explanations and when I submitted the survey - I got logged out of Coursemology and all my explanations were erased. I would just like to provide this feedback as I was genuinely devastated when all my lengthy explanations disappeared. No matter, I learnt quite a bit and had fun with this pre-survey. Thank you <3

P.S - I typed out all the explanations again, still sad though.",Break rings 3 and 8,"  (I would like to solve this problem without the aid of multiple choice, and would provide a reasoning without the use of elimination)

  Firstly, we attempt a single chain break. We yield a link of length 1, and two other links of total lengths (15-1) = 14.
These two links can be of any combination, but we find that the traveller would not make it past day 4 if the combination is 2/12. And not past day 2 if 3/11. We find that a single cut doesn't suffice.

We attempt two cuts now:
With two cuts attempted, we have obviously: 2 links of length 1. Our links in possession are then:
1,1, ?, ?, ?. 
Whereby the three unknown links have to add up to 13 in length.
While two length 1 chains suffice for the first two days. We lack into the third day. If we cut the chain such that 1,1,1,?,?. The two unknown chains will then be of total length 12. We can cut another link such that we have 1,1,1,1,11. But that would yield all days 5 to 10 unpayable. Hence, our option is to cut a chain of 2. Hence:
1,1,1,2,10. We are now presented with another issue: 6 cannot be formed. The gap between the second largest and largest number is too large.

Herein we have a clue, the second largest and largest number cannot have too large a gap, as the summation of all numbers till the second largest must be (largest number - 1) minimally. And that there must be a 2 for day three to be covered.

We try again at 1,1,2,?,?. Whereby the two unknown numbers must add up to 11. We start with the smallest gap possible:
5,6
4,7
3,8 (1+1+2+3 covers number 7, (8-1))
2,9 (1+1+2+2 does not cover all numbers from 7 till 8)
1,10 (1+1+1+1+2 does not cover all numbers from 7 till 9)

We now know that these combinations work:
1,1,2,5,6
1,1,2,4,7
1,1,2,3,8

Looking at the options, the only option in this multiple choice is cutting at 3 and 8 to yield links of these lengths.

","The solution is easier to find when generation 2 is treated symmetrically. In particular, each quadrant is symmetrical about a rotation from the center cell in the 'petri dish'.
We find that the only change is an additional live in the empty cell down 1 and left 2 from the center cell and looking at the bottom left quadrant, rotated for the other quadrants. (The resulting generation 3 is fairly symmetrical).
Herein, overcrowding begins to happen, particularly in the inner ring of generation 2 cells and die in generation 4(up and down 1 left and 1 right, as well as 1 left and 1 right from center). The cells down two and up two and left 1 and right also become populated as a result of the growth in cells in generation 3 bumping neighbour count of these empty cells to three.

PU - lift the cursor 'up', preventing it from leaving a line when moving
PD - reverse of PU
And that the cursor starts in an upward facing direction, at the bottom left of the screen.

With that in mind option 4 is most apt as REPEAT 4[FD60 RT90] draws a square and returns the cursor to the original vector direction and position.
PU FD 30 Rt 90 FD 30 LT 90 PD shifts the cursor to the center of the first square, by moving in half the square's length while PENUP (30 versus 60).

We then test for A being a Knight. B is a Knave, C and B are not the same 'types' and so C is a Knight. Hence, Knight A is always telling the truth.
A is a Knight. Therefore, the line of logic follows and is circular. A: Knight, B: Knave, C: Knight",8,"We take the initial statuses of the boxes to form simultaneous equations:

On day 1, he could give either ring 3 or ring 8 as payment. On day 2, he could give either rings 3 and 8 or Ring 1 to 2. From day 3 to 4, he could give any combination of rings 3, 8, 1 and 2. From day 5 to 8, he could give any combination of rings 3, 8, 1, 2, 4 to 7. Simply put, he could deploy the chain sets in any combination to fulfill the exact amount required from day 1 to 15.

The reason why breaking ring 8 alone is insufficient is because it does not provide enough units of small enough value in order to fulfill the requirements for certain days. For example, he could not pay just 2 rings on day 2 because he cannot form a 2 ring chain for payment.

Since breaking rings 3 and 8 can provide for all combinations of ring requirements for payment for only 2 broken rings, being the lowest viable broken ring combination of all 5 options, all other combinations need not be considered.",bbbbbbbbbbcddde;bbbbbbbbbbcddde,"Throughout the pattern, the number of 'c' and 'e' strings do not change.

'd' corresponds to the number of iterations of the cycle. 'd' = n-1 where n is the number of cycles generated by the pattern.

If we only break ring 8, this means m=we have pieces of 7 rings, 1 ring, and 7 rings. This means that the traveler cannot even pay 2 rings to the inn-keeper by day 2. It does not satisfy the traveler's want of paying only 2 rings on the 2nd day. Now, let's say we attempt to break 2 rings. If we break rings 5 and 10, then we have pieces of 4 rings, 1 ring, 4 rings, 1 ring, and 4 rings. Unfortunately, the traveler, won't be able to pay 7 rings. So this does not work. Now, let's say we break rings 3 and 8. Now, we have pieces of 2 rings, 1 ring, 4 rings, 1 ring, and 7 rings.

This means that no cell will die when in [Generation 2]. Since the points (2, 4), (6, 4), (2, 6), (6, 6) have exactly 3 neighbours, these 4 points will be populated in the [Generation 3].

Hence, my answer for Question 20 is option 4. ","A - knight, B - knave, C - knight
","Firstly, let us explore a scenario where A is a knight. If that is the case, A is telling the truth which means B must be a knave. This will also mean that B is lying and that B and C should have different identities, therefore C must be a knight. To verify that this scenario is possible, we look at the last statement which states that C claims that A is not lying, which is in fact true since both of them are knights who always tell the truth. Therefore, option 5 is eliminated. Next let us explore another scenario where A is a knave. If that is the case, A must be lying and that B must be a knight. This will also mean that B is telling the truth and that B and C should have the same identity, therefore C must be a knight. To verify if this scenario is possible, we look at the last statement once again which states that C claims that A is not lying, which is actually false since A is a knave who always lies. Therefore, option 6 is eliminated and my answer for Question 22 is option 4.",8,"Looking at the last line of statement, if there are 3 times as many apples in boxes A and C combined when compared to box B, this means that the total number of apples in all 3 boxes should be divisible by 4 units (assuming box B represents 1 unit and boxes A and C combined represents 3 units). This helps us to eliminate options 1, 4 and 5. The next step is a trial-and-error process whereby we substitute the total number of apples in all 3 boxes to be 8, 12, and 20 respectively to see if any of these options fulfils all the conditions of the question. Otherwise, the answer would be option 7. Looking at the 3rd line, if 1 apple is taken from B and placed in C, box C will have 6 times the number of apples in box A. This means that A + C + 1 should be divisible by 7 units (assuming box A represents 1 unit). Using trial-and-error, if the total number of apples in all 3 boxes is 8, that means that A + C = 6 apples and B = 2 apples. Therefore, A + C + 1 = 6 + 1 = 7 which is a factor of 7. That means A = 1 apple and C + 1 = 6 apples, therefore C = 6 - 1 = 5 apples. So currently, we have A = 1 apple, B = 2 apples and C = 5 apples. To double-check our answer, we look at the 2nd line which states that C - 1 = A + 1 + B. In this case, 5 - 1 = 1 + 1 + 2 = 4, since the final equation holds true, thus my answer for Question 24 is option 2.",Chong Shao Wei,53.0,0.95,24448.0,0.919687396075823,148.0,23.6,False,Esther,250,250,275,275,250,250,250,250,225,-,,0,1935

To explain:
Initially, y = 5

For each instances of j as the value of 1 to 15, the 'y=y+1' will occur.

When j=1, y = 5 + 1
Resulting in y = 6 as the most updated value of y.

When j=2, y = 6 + 1
Resulting in y = 7 as the most updated value of y.

This would repeat until when j = 14, where the previous value of y is 18 (when j = 13)
Resulting in y = 19 as the last value of y.",30,"With z = h(10), x is defined as 10 into function h(x) which would result in:
return g(10) * 2 where z = g(10) * 2

with g(10), x is defined as 10 into function g(x) which would result in:
return 10 + 5 
Hence, g(10) would give the value of 15 which when returned to the function of h(10) would result in:
return 15 * 2
Hence, z would give 30.",5/21,"For the numerator value the pattern is as follows:

next: 2 +1 -2 +3 -4 +5 = 5

For the denominator value the pattern is as follows:

next: 1 +2 +3
next: 1 +2 +3 +4
next: 1 +2 +3 +4 +5

","If A is a knight:
B is a knave, therefore B and C are not the same
C is hence a knight which means that A is also a knight.

To me, the computer is one of mankind’s greatest inventions. Computer science is in essence, learning how to replicate the way the human brain processes information and instruction with a machine.

It is obvious that the machine can outperform the human in terms of memory and the complexity of various operations it can process, including calculations, sequences of instructions.

How well we maximise the machine to plug the gaps and limitations of the human mind depends on how well we are able to communicate instructions, problem-solving and decision-making processes to the machine. This is the meaning and purpose of computational thinking to me that I seek to practise and refine through this module. That is, learning how to write a sequence of instructions to a computer by understanding how it ‘thinks’, so that the computer can return us solutions to problems that are beyond our mental processing and capacity limits.

But we are only allowed to do so if we break the correct minimum number. Obviously, 1 ring alone is out of the question. Let’s try breaking only 2 rings.

The principle is to, while breaking the minimum number of rings, to also minimise the length of the largest intact chain, but also allow the smaller chains and broken rings to cover as many days as possible before we pay the longest chain.

Also, it must be such that in the event the traveller is not holding on to any broken ring, he can trade the intact chain he is holding on with the denominations he has given the innkeeper in such a way he only pays a net sum of one ring.

If we break 3 and 8, we have the denominations:
1(ring 3)+1(ring 8)+2(rings 1&2)+4(rings 4-7)+7(rings 9-15)
Day1: Pay Ring 3
Day 2: Pay ring 1&2, take back ring 3, .

Day 6: Pay broken ring 3.
Day 7: Pay 1&2 and take back broken ring 8. 
1+4+1 becomes 1+4+2.
Day 8: Pay ring 8. 
Day 9: We have delayed paying the largest denomination long enough. We have already paid all smaller ones. So we pay 9-15th rings and take back 4-7 and the two broken rings 3 and 8.

Day 10: Pay broken ring 3

7+2+1+1 becomes 7+4+1.
Day 13: Pay broken ring 8.

For the third and fourth term, the principle is the same but now the value to add and subtract from the first left number(which is 2) is 2. so 2+2=4 in the left number in the fourth term and 2-2=0 for the left number in the 5th term. following this, the left number in the 6th term should be 2+3=5. 
for the right number in each term, the increase in the value goes up by 1 for the next term. so 1+2=3 in the second term, but from the second to the third term, the value added is now one higher than before so the increase should be 3, therefore: 3+3=6, same for the interval between 3rd and fourth term.

The FOR statements loops through each iteration for the values within the range starting with 1 and ending with 15 (not inclusive). Therefore, it loops through the statement 14 times.

Question 15: 
For i and j, the values that were assigned to them before the FOR statement merely assigns value to them and does not affect the FOR statement. However, in the FOR statement, it acts an indicator to assign each iteration for the range.

Question 16:
Since the range starts with 1 and ends with 15, it will loop through 14 times.

Once the x value is being inputted into the g(x) function, the g(x) function returns x+5, which in this case is 10+5=15.

","We can consider what B says first as he provided the most information. He mentioned that B & C are both knights or both knaves. There are 2 possibilities that could occur which is either he is a knight or knave.
If B is a knight, both B & C will be knights as what B said must be true and as B is already a knight, C will also be a knight. However, if B is a knave, it would mean that C is a knight as he would be lying and B & C will be different as they cannot be both knights or both knaves. Therefore, currently B is still either a knight or knave but we have confirmed that C is a knight.

Looking at C's statement, C states that A is not lying which means that A is a knight.

Looking at A's statement, A states that B is a knave and since A is a knight and is telling the truth, B is a knave.

Therefore, A is a knight, B is a knave and C is a knight. ",8,"From the first statement, the first simultaneous equation can be formed: A+1+B = C-1 where it can be simplified to C = A+B+2

Given that Python is a popular and widely used language, I also would like to take this chance to properly get to know and familiarise myself with it.","I have previously tried learning Python on my own but one thing that I struggled with was the limited number of practices to check my understanding and overall learning progress. Thus, it would be great if there were more optional resources for students to try out in their free time as I believe that it will be beneficial especially for those who are new to programming in general.",Break rings 3 and 8,"Firstly from the question, there are two strict conditions that the chosen answer has to satisfy:
1. innkeeper must NOT on any day have more rings than he is due on that day
2. a minimum number of rings are broken

Other important things to note is that for every break in a ring, there will be a total of 3 new segments produced, with the broken ring being one of them. In addition, it is also possible to trade rings to fulfil the number of rings due on that day such that the 2 conditions above are satisfied.

My answer is ""break rings 3 and 8"". When we break rings 3 and 8, we will have 5 different segments each consisting of 2, 1, 4, 1 and 7 rings respectively. Using the different segments and trading system, the following is how the payment of rings can be conducted:
D1: 1
D2: 1 + 1
D3: 2 + 1 (trade 1 out)
D4: 2 + 1 + 1
D5: 4 + 1 (trade 1, 2 out)
D6: 4 + 1 + 1 
D7: 4 + 2 + 1 (trade 1 out)
D8: 4 + 2 + 1 + 1
D9: 7 + 2 (trade 1, 1, 4 out)
D10: 7 + 2 + 1
D11: 7 + 2 + 1 +1
D12: 7 + 4 + 1  (trade 1, 2 out)
D13: 7 + 4 + 2 (trade 1 out)
D14: 7 + 4 + 2 + 1 
D15: 7 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 1

The answer is not ""break ring 8"" or ""break ring 5 and 10"" because in both instances there is no possible way for the innkeeper to not have more rings than is due on that day.
- When we ""break ring 8"", there will be 3 segments each with 7, 1 and 7 rings. On the second day, there is no way to pay the innkeeper 2 rings only. 
- When we ""break 5 and 10"", there will be 5 segments each with 4, 1, 4, 1, and 5 rings. On the third day, there is no way to pay the innkeeper 3 rings only.
Thus both answers are wrong as they do not satisfy the 1st condition.

The answer is also not ""break rings 3, 7 and 11"" or ""break rings 4, 8 and 12"". Although both instances satisfy the first condition, there are a total of three broken rings, which is more than the two broken rings in the option ""break rings 3 and 8"". Thus both answers are wrong as the number of rings broken is not the smallest possible number and the second condition is not satisfied.",bbbbbbbbbbcddde,"From the sequence above, we can observe that a total of n ""b"" and 1 ""d"" will be added to the previous term (n - 1)th term to derive the nth term.

","I drew out the diagram to solve this question.

For generation 3, none of the cells die. However, four additional cells were added in the four corners, leaving the middle area of the diamond shape from generation 2 with a square shape.

Taking into account that a cell becomes populated when it has three neighbours, I firstly deduce that the fifth option from the left is wrong because there should be three populated cells in the top row. 

Option four was also not the answer I was looking for as it was not possible for there to be a populated cell in the middle of the diagram given that it will have four or more neighbours and will die.

Option one was wrong because the single populated cell at the bottom of the diagram disappeared. However, this is not possible given that it was not surrounded by four or more neighbours and should not die.

Lastly, I was left with options two and three, which differed only by two cells. I then deduced the answer to be option two as the two additional cells present in option three should have died and not be present in generation 4 given that it was surrounded by more than four neighbours in generation 3.","REPEAT 3 [REPEAT 4 [FD 60 RT 90] PU FD 30 RT 90 FD 30 LT 90 PD]
","from (i), we can observe that:
- FD gives an output of a blue line that moves from the bottom up 
- PU gives a blank output, where the blue line does not appear and this will continue until the command PD is given
- the numerical value that comes after each command is the distance/length of the output of the given command 

from (ii), we can observe that:
- RT 90 means turning the direction of the output by 90 degrees in the right direction
- LT 90 means turning the direction of the output by 90 degrees in the left direction
- REPEAT [code] results in the entire code in the square brackets being run twice;  

I chose option four as the answer as the code REPEAT 4 [FD 60 RT 90] gives an output of a blue square. Following that, the code PU FD 30 RT 90 FD30 LT 90 PD navigates the output to start in the middle of the newly drawn blue square, and the REPEAT 3 [code] at the beginning repeats the above processes to produce two more blue squares as shown in the final output.",6,4,5,Not enough information to decide,"From the given example, we can observe that when 
- operator A is applied, the output can be derived by adding one to the integer
- operator B is applied, the output can be derived by multiplying the integer by two
- either operator A or B is applied n times, the effect on the integer will also be n times

Q9. Operator A is applied thrice to the integer 3, hence the output is 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 6

Q10. Operator A is first applied to the integer 1, followed by operator B. Hence the output is (1 + 1) x 2 = 4

Q11. Operator B is first applied to the integer 2, followed by operator A. Hence the output is (2 x 2) + 1 = 5

Q12. In this question, operator A is applied to the integer 1, w times followed by operator B and gives an output of 999. There is no solution for w because if we were to work backwards, 999 divided by 2 gives a result which has a decimal. However, it impossible for there to be an output with a decimal from the application of operator A as the addition of integer 1 to the original integer 1 can only give an integer output.","It causes the statement <code>y = y + 1</code> to repeat 15 times.

Hence, in the similar programme, given the range for j, I would think thank it would similarly cause y = y + 1 to repeat in a loop for 15 times.

Q15. I chose the option that i and j keep track of the number of times 1 is added because there is a range given for i and j, meaning they can change and are likely to be counters marking every time the loop is repeated.

Q16. Given that the loop y = y + 1 is repeated 15 times, I chose the answer 20 as 1 will be added to the original y value of 5 fifteen times.",30,"z = h (10)

- (n-1) is added to a of the previous term if n is a even number or subtracted from a of the previous term if n is an odd number
- n is added to b of the previous term

Since we are finding the 6th term, and 6 is an even number,
we can derive it from adding (6-1) to 0 and add 6 to 15 to get the answer 5/21.","A - knight, B - knave, C - knight
","Given that a knight always tells the truth while a knave always lie, 
we can deduce from A's statement that there are only 2 possible scenarios for A and B:
scenario 1 - if A is a knight, B is a knave
scenario 2 - if A is a knave, B is a knight

We can thus omit options 2 and 3, where A and B are both knaves or knights.

Testing scenario 1:
if A is a knight and is telling the truth, B must be a knave, and the statement made by B 'C and I are both knights or both knaves' is not true. 
Hence, C must be a knight which tallies since C is telling the truth that A is not lying.

Testing scenario 2:
if A is a knave and is telling a lie, B must be a knight and is telling the truth. 
Hence, C must likewise be a knight. However, C cannot be a knight in this scenario because he would be lying that A is telling the truth. 
As such, scenario 2 is not feasible.

Given that scenario 1 works, we can thus omit options 5 and 6, as there is only one possibility.
Checking scenario one with options 1 and 4, we can then deduce the answer is option 4.",8,"From the above, we can deduce that

The number of 1,2,4,8 is enough to count from 1 to 15. With 2 cuts, it will give me 2 individual links. So, I want to make 2 cuts in position 3 and 8, which means there will be links with length 2,1,4,1, and 7.
Then I check whether all the number from 1 to 15 could be created from these links:
Day:
1 = 1 link
2 = 1+1 links
3=2+1 (take back 1)
4 = 4 (take back 2 and 1)
5 = 4+1
6=4+2(take back 1)
7=7(take back 4 and 2)
8=7+1
9=7+2(take back 1)
10=7+1+2
11=7+4(take back 1 and 2)
12=7+4+1
13=7+4+2(take back 1
14=7+4+2+1
15=7+4+2+1+1

-first term has 3 characters, second term has 6 , and third term has 10. The difference between 1st and 2nd terms is 3 and the difference between 2nd and 3rd term is 4. The difference between each term is incremented by 1 each time going for the next term. So, the fourth term will have 10+5= 15 characters.
-number of b in 1st term is 2, in 2nd term is 3 and in 3rd term is 6. The difference is incremented by 1 each time. So, in the 4th term it will have 10 b(s).
-the number of c between each terms is constant. So, there will be only 1 c in the 4th term either.
-the difference of the number of d in each terms is 1. So, there will be 3 d(s) in the 4th term.
-the number of e in each terms is constant. So, there will be only 1 e in the 4th term.
-If we add the number of each letters (10+1+3+1), the result will be 15.

I found that A is +1 and B is *2
1 -> A -> B -> y:
(1). 1+1=2
(2). 2*2=4=y
for question number 12, we need to do the addition first since A was applied first. Hence, we need to find the result from the addition before applying operators B. In other words we can write it like this (1+A+...+A)*2=999. Since the result of 999/2 is not an integer while knowing that the result of (1+a+...+a) is an integer, I concluded that there is no solution for this question.","It causes the statement <code>y = y + 1</code> to repeat 14 times.

For the numerator, I see the pattern between the even terms and the odd terms. For every next odd terms, the value will be from previous odd term-1 . For every next even terms, the values is from previous even term + 1. So for the numerator for the 6th term it will be 4+1 =5.
Hence, the 6th term will be 5/21

On day 1 he will give ring 3. On Day 2 he will exchange ring 3 for rings 1 and 2. On Day 3 he will give ring 3.

Next he should have at least a set of 4 to account for the payment on day 4. In order to have a set of 4, he should break the 8th ring to obtain rings 4, 5, 6 and 7 as a set of 4 rings. Breaking rings in the other options (4, 5, 7, 10, 12) will not get rings in a set of four, after my initial decision to break ring 3.
On Day 4 he will exchange ring 3 and rings 1&2 for the set of four rings: ring 4, 5, 6, 7. On Day 5, He will give ring 3 to make the total rings 5. On Day 6, he will exchange the single ring 3 for the double ring (1 and 2), to bring the total rings to 6. And on Day 7, he will give ring 3 to have 7 rings in total.

What is left is a single ring, ring 8, and a set of 7 rings, rings 9 to 15. 

On Day 8, he will give the single ring, ring 8, to make the total 8 rings. On the 9th Day, the traveller will exchange these rings (1&2 and 4 to 7, total 6 rings) from the innkeeper to rings 9 to 15 (7 rings in total), to make up a final total of 9 rings (rings 3, 8, 9 to 15)
On Day 10, he will be returned ring 3 and will give the innkeeper rings 1 and 2. Day 11, he gives ring 3 to make the total 11 rings.

On Day 12, he will trade rings 4 to 7 for the innkeeper's rings 1 & 2 and 3. On Day 13, he gives the innkeeper ring 3 again, making the total 13 rings. On Day 14, he once again takes back ring 3 to give the innkeeper rings 1 & 2. Innkeeper's rings by the 14th day: Rings 1 & 2, 4 to 7, 8, 9 to 15.

Finally on the final day, Day 15, he gives the innkeeper the last ring, ring 3, to make the total rings given 15 rings.

When the question stated that ""breaking a ring reduces its value"" I can eliminate options 4 and 5 since they require 3 rings to be broken. Option 1 can also be eliminated since breaking of only 1 ring will not allow the innkeeper to only have N rings on any N^th given day.

After that, all that is left to do is to test out Options 2 and 3.

I started by testing Option 2.

On 2nd day, trade the set of 2 rings for the set of 1 ring back. This way, the innkeeper only has 2 rings.
On 3rd day, pay innkeeper another set of 1 ring. 
On 4th day, pay innkeeper another set of 1 ring. 
On 5th day, trade the set of 4 rings for 1 set of 2 rings and 1 set of 1 ring back. This way, the innkeeper has 1 set of 4 and 1 set of 1 which makes it 5.
On 6th day, pay innkeeper another set of 1 ring.
On 7th day, trade innkeeper the set of 7 rings and take everything else back.

Thus it can be seen that the number of integers in the given range denotes the number of times x+1 or y+1 happens.
Q15: Since the range is the range of i and j, i and j keeps track of the number of times x+1 or y+1 happens.

The magnitudes of the differences increase by 1 each time and the operator +/- alternates. Following the pattern, to obtain the sixth term in the sequence, 5 should be added to the fifth term , 0, obtaining 5.
The second sequence contains 1, 3, 6, 10, 15. The differences between the numbers are +2, +3, +4, +5 respectively. The magnitudes of the differences increase by 1 each time and the difference is always positive. Thus the sixth term of the sequence should be 15+6=21

The first point to note is that ""Along the way, the traveler is permitted to trade for some of the rings he had earlier given to the inn-keeper"". This means we can simplify the question to using numbers that are as few as possible to express all numbers from 1 to 15. We know that the minimum numbers to use are 1,2,4,8. 
The second point to note is that after one cut at the xth ring, the three chains produced have ring numbers of (x-1),1,(15-x) respectively. After one cut, the total number of separate parts (i.e the numbers of numbers used to count from 1 to 15) increases by 2. Hence, we eliminate choices 1, 4, and 5 as two cuts will suffice which produce 5 separate parts. (5>4)
Then we start to see the answer, as the one that produces 1,2,4,8 (with sum also can) is the correct answer. we can see that there's more than 1 correct answer as well, as seen from some examples listed below.
1,1,2,3,8 (with 1+1+2 added up to 4)
1,1,2,4,7 (with 1+7 added up to 8)
1,1,2,2,8 (with 1+1 added up to 2 and 2+2 added up to 4)
1,1,1,4,8 (with 1+1 added up to 2)

Hence option 2 is the correct answer in my opinion.",bbbbbbbbbbcddde,"My first instinct when seeing this question is that there might be more than one pattern that produces the exact same first three terms. But I could only be able to identify one. 
number of b in each term: 1,3,6

hence, the next term would be 6+4=10
number of d in each term: 0,1,2
which is an arithmetic progression with common difference 1, a=0. Hence the next term would be 3
Hence, the next pattern is

Hence, the first possibility is A is knight, B is knave, C is a knight.
Then assume C and A are knaves, then B is knight, this fails as according to B, C should be knight but C is not.

And thus, i am a little concern about whether i will be able to follow along or if i might need more time and help to grasp the concept. In addition, I am a bit less used to voluntary social settings, and so i am a little concern about how i will get along with my tutors and my 'classmates' in terms of asking questions or during tutorials. But nevertheless, I will not know how i will cope with it until I try it out to the best of my current capabilities. ","Break rings 3, 7 and 11","When i break the rings at 3,7 and 11. I get a sequence of chains as follows: 2,1,3,1,3,1,4. On the first 3 days, we can pay in a series of 1s, and take them back and replace them with the chain of 4. Then on the 5th day, 4+1. On the 6th day 4+2 (taking back the 1) and continue adding 1s until the 10th day, where we take back the 1s and 2s and pay with 4+3+3. 11th day: 4+3+3+1. 12th day: 4+3+3+2, and we continue paying 1 per day until the last day, day 15th: 4+3+3+2+1+1+1. This way, we can ensure that the traveler will not pay more than he is due on any day. 

Breaking rings 4,8 and 12 will work as well, which gives us a sequence as follows: 3,1,3,1,3,1,3, with the following, 1: 1,2:1+1,3:3(take back 1s),4:3+1,5:3+1+1,6:3+3(take back 1s) and so on, until day 15, which will be 3+3+3+3+1+1+1.",bbbbbbbbbbcddde,"If we label the above sequence with 1,2,3,4.

","For me personally, i judge from the keywords and the 2 outputs given to me, i assumed that the numbers are distance in which the pen moves, either PU or PD, as well as angles the pen turns, RT 90, being turning right by 90 degree angle I imagined an arrow, following the codes to produce the outputs accordingly in a grid like format, with one grid being 60. Option 1 resulted in an incomplete output, in comparison with the output expected In addition, a code of [FD 60 RT 90 LT 90] will result in my arrow proceeding upwards and thus i eliminated options 2 and 3. I focused on options 4 and 5 as [REPEAT 4 [FD 60 RT 90] will give me a square, which i am looking for. Options 4 and 5 both seems similar, but i did not need the PU after the RT 90 in [REPEAT 4 [FD 60 RT 90] and thus eliminated it as well. With the given output 1, only one PD is required for 1 PU in order for the pen to touch down, and thus, i assumed if 1 PU moves up the pen on a vertical axis by 1, PU PU will move it up by 2, and PD will only result in my arrow being 1 grid above the imaginary plane. But these are simply my unsure assumptions, i just mainly drew them out by hand and came to the exact pattern with option 4. ",6,4,5,Not enough information to decide,"Considering the pattern given to us, I deduce that A should be, if I'm not wrong, +1 and B * 2. So I substituted A and B, with the corresponding numbers they represent and use mathematics to calculate the answer. For Q 9, 3+1+1+1 gives us 6. For Q10, 1+1*2 gives us 4. Q 11, 2*2+1 gives us 5 and for Q12, i tried to work backwards, with dividing 999 with 2, with gives us a decimal, and started from 1+1, to 999/2-1, which i don't really think give us enough information to decide.","It causes <code>j</code> to be incremented 14 times.

That x = 2, i = 0, when i is in range of 0 to 10, the equation x=x+1 will occur, i will go from 0,1,2,...,10, at first, i assume range will mean that it will end on i=10, however that will give me x=13 and not x=12, thus i assume that it might have ended at i=9 instead and applied the same method for the second equation. for j in range (1,15):  y=y+1. As j=0, i did not count the first jump from j=0 to j=1, and started from there and ended on j=14,  where the statement y=y+1 is only repeated 13 times, while j increased by 14. Thus my answer for Q 14 is j being incremented for 14 times. Throughout this, i noticed that i and j are seemingly 'counting' up until they are limited by the range, which also helped to keep track of how many times 1 is added to x and y respectively, thus, i selected my answer for Q15 as such.

As in, If A is a knave, B will have to be a knight as A will be lying about B being a knave, B being a knight, will be telling the truth, meaning C will be a knight as well, however, C, being a knight,  have to be telling the truth, which is contradictory, as A is a knave, meaning that A is lying. Option 3 is contradictory as well, if A is a Knight, it means that B is a Knave, and not a knight. Option 4 is the only one that makes sense. If A is a knight, B will have to be a knave, and thus B's statement is false and C will not be a knave with B, but a knight.

Afterwards, i substitute (x) into (2), which gives me a+2+b+1=6a, after simplifying this by moving the numbers around using basic algebra, i will get b=5a-3, which i label (y). Then i substitute (x) and (y) into (3), which gives me a+a+2+5a-3=3(5a-3), after moving and simplifying again, i eventually get 8=8a, which gives me a=1.
